## Welcome to InKorea!

Living abroad in a country can be confusing and even difficult. Each country has their own system and Korea is no different. 
Sometimes the grocery stores aren't open on the weekend. The address system might be different from the one back home. There is a festival that you only hear about after its over. It is especially difficult if you are a foreigner and it is your first time in Korea. There are alot of guides written on tourist attractions and whatnot, but there isn't alot of material on how to make a smooth transition.

### What is Out There Already?
1. [IsHomePlusOpen](https://ishomeplusopen.com/#top)
    - This website informs you if popular grocery stores like Homeplus is open on any current day.

3. [ePost](https://ishomeplusopen.com/#top)
    - This website allows you to convert your address from the Korean format to the English format and vice versa.

5. [InterNations](https://www.internations.org/go/moving-to-south-korea/living)
    - This website provides a comprehensive list of everything you'd need to live in Korea as a foreigner.

### What We Propose To Do
InKorea aims to consolidate useful features taken from here and there to give you useful tools for adjusting to Korea. There may be individual websites and applications that give you advice on living in Korea, but there isn't one that combines all that information into a beautiful user interface and presentation.

At the very least, InKorea hopes to combine the three websites mentioned above into a singular experience with the following modules
1) A module that tells if a grocery store is open right now
2) A module that helps convert your address in Korea to any other format
3) A module that tells you of popular seasonal events that you might miss out on

### How We Will Improve Our Product
InKorea will go out and meet with foreigners in person and ask them for their opinions. Each member with ask a different foreigner what they thought was difficult when first adjusting to Korea and what sort of tools they wish they had.

InKorea will take that information and present it back to you in a website that is both easy to use and pleasant to look at.
